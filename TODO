  - There's a bug with prompt repetitions with packet patch set.

  - Deal with escaping { } / ; in #script variables.

  - Make tintin char setting by session instead of global.

    + tintin.sourceforge.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF FOR A RAINY DAY

  check https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/basic_extended.html

- cursor extension for vim

- interactive script tutorial

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

- Keep last input visible with repeat enter enabled.

- would be nice to have "#map list" show the variable being filtered on, instead of defaulting to roomname ie, I'm currently writing a script to save "#map list {roomnote} {{\w+}}" into a variable, then map get roomnote for each item in the list and display it...would be nice if when listing for a roomnote, it showed the roomnote

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF THAT WON'T BE IMPLEMENTED

- Lua or any other scripting language, focus is on developing tintin scripting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ISSUES

- TinTin++ only allows 1 action triggering per line.

- TinTin++ probably should substitute escapes in if checks.

- TinTin++ is not handling #return inside #regex intuitively.
